= How to Install SubEtha =

These instructions describe setting up a single, standalone instance of SubEtha.  You should have have installed JDK 1.5+ and whatever database you intend to use (MySQL and PostgreSQL are tested by the application developers, but any DB supported by Hibernate - with blob object support - should work).

= Install Steps =

  # Create an empty database in your database server.  Note that SubEtha will create the database tables for you when it runs for the first time.
  # Download and install Resin 4.0.0 (or greater) as per the Resin instructions.  The resin install directory is in this document as ${resin.dir}.
  # Download and copy the appropriate JDBC driver jar for your database into ${resin.dir}/lib.
  # Download and unzip the SubEtha distribution into a temporary directory.
  # Copy se.war to ${resin.dir}/webapps/
  # Copy [http://subetha.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/example-subetha.xml example-subetha.xml] to ${resin.dir}/conf/subetha.xml (renaming the file)

Please see ReceivingMail for specific instructions on how to integrate with your mail MTA.

== Startup ==
Start up Resin by running ${resin.dir}/bin/resin.sh or resin.bat. The default web interface is http://localhost:8080/se/. When SubEtha runs for the first time, it creates a site administrator account named "*root@localhost*", with the password "*password*".

*Change the administrator password immediately*. This can be done from the web interface. In addition, change the site properties as described in the AdminGuide.

You are now ready to continue with the AdminGuide.
