= How to Install SubEtha =

These instructions describe setting up a single, standalone instance of SubEtha.  You should have have installed JDK 1.5+ and whatever database you intend to use (MySQL and PostgreSQL are tested by the application developers, but any DB supported by Hibernate should work).

= Install Steps =
  # Install Resin 4.0.0 (or greater).  The resin install directory is in this document as ${resin.dir}.
  # Create an empty database in your database server.  Note that SubEtha will create the database tables for you when it runs for the first time.
  # Set up the JDBC data source in Resin. Edit ${resin.dir}/conf/resin.xml and add the following section anywhere under the root level:
  {{{
	<resin>
		<!-- blah blah blah -->

		<database jndi-name="jdbc/subetha">
			<ping>true</ping>
			<ping-interval>0</ping-interval>
			<ping-query>select 1;</ping-query>

			<driver type="org.postgresql.Driver">
				<url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/subetha</url>
				<!-- Best practice: Create a separate database user for this applicaiton -->
				<user>yourdatabaseusername</user>
				<password>yourpassword</password>
			</driver>
		</database>

		<!-- blah blah blah -->
	</resin>
   }}}
  #  Copy the appropriate JDBC driver jar for your database into ${resin.dir}/lib.
  #  Copy se.war to ${resin.dir}/webapps/

== Integrate with your MTA ==

Please see the MtaGuide for specific instructions for your mail server.

== Startup ==

Start up Resin by running ${resin.dir}/bin/resin.sh or resin.bat. The default web interface is http://localhost:8080/se/. When SubEtha runs for the first time, it creates a site administrator account named "*root@localhost*", with the password "*password*".

*Change the administrator password immediately*. This can be done from the web interface. In addition, change the site properties as described in the AdminGuide.

You are now ready to continue with the AdminGuide.
