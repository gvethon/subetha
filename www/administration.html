			<h1>SubEtha Administration Guide</h1>
			
			<p>
				This document assumes you have read and understood the
				<a href="install.html">Install Instructions</a>.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Concepts</h2>
			
			<p>
				If you are familiar with mailing list managers, SubEtha should be easy
				to master.  The basic ideas are that:
			</p>
			
			<h3>User Accounts</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					User accounts are created by subscribing to a mailing list with
					an email address.
				</li>
				<li>Each user account can have multiple email addresses.</li>
				<li>Each user account can have subscriptions to multiple lists, and designate
					which email address each list will deliver to.</li>
				<li>
					If a user is subscribed to a list (and has permission to post), email
					from any email address associated with that account will be accepted
					to the list.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a user with an existing account adds an email address that is
					already associated with another account, the two accounts are automatically
					and intelligently merged into a single account.
				</li>
				<li>
					Any time a user wishes to add a new email address to their account
					(either manually or by subscribing to a mailing list), a roundtrip
					confirmation using a token is required.
				</li>
				<li>
					Confirmation tokens are completely stateless; no changes are made
					on the server until the token is confirmed.  If a token is lost
					or sent to the wrong address, simply repeat the add/signup process.
				</li>
				<li>
					Some accounts are designated as Site Administrators.  In addition
					to the ability to create mailiing lists, site administrators have
					full permissions on all mailing lists.
				</li>
				<li>
					Only Site Administrators can grant or revoke the Site Administrator
					privelage.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Mailing lists are created by Site Administrators.
				</li>
				<li>
					The list creator decides two critical pieces of information:
					<ol>
						<li>
							The mailing list email address, which must be unique on the site.
							The entire address (including domain) is significant; thus
							announce@yourdomain.com and announce@otherdomain.com are different
							lists.  Of course, DNS MX records must actually route this mail to
							the host that SubEtha is running on.
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The "official" public URL to the list's website, e.g. 
							http://www.yourdomain.com/se/list/announce.  This URL must
							contain the special context path "/se/list/" but is otherwise
							entirely arbitrary.  Of course, any URL you use must actually
							resolve to SubEtha.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Mailing lists have an arbitrary set of Roles, each of which have permissions 
					such as POST and EDIT_FILTERS.  The list owner decides what roles exist and
					what permissions they have.  A permission is always relative to a list.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each list has a special Owner role which has all permissions on the list.
					The Owner role cannot be deleted or modified.  Thus, at minimum, all lists
					have at least this one role.
				</li>
				<li>
					The list owner designates one role which will automatically be assigned
					to new list subscribers.  This is the "default" role.
				</li>
				<li>
					The list owner designates one role which will be the effective role of any
					users who have not logged in.  This is the "anonymous" role.
				</li>
				<li>
					To make it clear by way of example, a user visiting the archives page
					for a mailing list will be allowed to view the archives only if at least
					one of the following conditions is true:
					<ul>
						<li>The user is logged in and the user is a site administrator.</li>
						<li>
							The user is logged in, the user is subscribed to the list, and the
							user's subscription role has permission VIEW_ARCHIVES.
						</li>
						<li>
							The user is not logged in and the special "anonymous" role
							has permission VIEW_ARCHIVES.
						</li>
					</ul>
					Note that users who are not permitted to view list archives will
					not be displayed the View Archives menu item.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Moderation Holds</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					List owners can configure a mailing list to hold all subscription
					requests for manual approval.  When a subscription request arrives,
					notification is sent to all users who have permission to APPROVE_SUBSCRIPTIONS.
				</li>
				<li>
					Arriving messages can be held in two ways, HARD and SOFT.
					<ul>
						<li>
							HARD holds require explicit moderator (anyone with APPROVE_MESSAGES permission)
							approval from the website.  Only filters can trigger this type of hold,
							and moderators are notified via email when the message is held.
						</li>
						<li>
							SOFT holds occur when mail arrives to a list from an email address
							that does not have POST permission (ie, the address is associated with
							an account that lacks the permission or the address is not associated
							with a subscribed account and the special anonymous role for the list
							does not grant POST permission).  SOFT holds can potentially be 
							self-moderated in one of two ways:
							<ol>
								<li>
									The email address is added to an account that is already subscribed,
									and that subscribed account has a role with POST permission.  This
									would be the case when a subscribed user posts from a new email
									address, then adds the new address to their account.
								</li>
								<li>
									The poster subscribes the email address with a new account and 
									the default role for the mailing list has POST permission.
								</li>
							</ol>
							Note that moderators are not notified via email about SOFT holds.
							Typically SOFT holds are spam.  The poster is given sufficient instruction
							to properly self-moderate the hold (ie, subscribe to the list).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					There is no specially designated "moderator" account.  You either have
					the APPROVE_MESSAGES/APPROVE_SUBSCRIPTIONS permissions or you do not.
					List owners who wish to create special moderator-only accounts can
					create a "Moderator" role with only that permission; in fact several
					of the blueprints do exactly this.
				</li>
				<li>
					Generally speaking, moderators should check for subscription holds
					and ignore message holds (which will usually be spam).  Non-spammers
					can self-moderate their own messages.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Programming</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					SubEtha is a true three-tiered application.  Nearly everything you
					can do from the website can be automated using the remote EJB
					interface.  This interface is fully contained in core-api.jar.
				</li>
				<li>
					SubEtha offers two kinds of plugins:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Filters manipulate email either as it arrives or as it
							is sent (or both).  Each filter defines a set of configuration
							parameters that list owners can set on a per-list basis.
						</li>
						<li>
							Blueprints initialize a new mailing list with a set of configuration
							options.  This includes basic settings, enabled filters,
							filter arguments, roles, and permissions.  No matter what
							blueprint a list is created with, list owners are free to reconfigure
							the list afterwards.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Plugins are hot-deployable as JBoss services.  SubEtha gracefully handles
					filters that have been enabled on lists but are subsequently removed
					from the JBoss instance - even at runtime.
				</li>
				<li>
					Plugins run inside the SubEtha JVM and run with site administrator
					privelage.  Techncially this means they can do almost anything.
					We recommend you stick to the APIs in core-api.jar; any other API
					is considered internal and highly likely to change without notice.
				</li>
			</ul>
