			<h1>Migrating from Mailman</h1>
						
			<p>
			Migrating from Mailman to SubEtha Mail is easy. Start off by creating
			your new list in SubEtha Mail and setting up all of the appropriate
			filters and list settings.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Get the subscriber list and mbox file from your mailman installation.
			Obtain the .mbox file from 
			${mailman.home}/archives/${list.name}.mbox/${list.name}.mbox and
			use the ${mailman.home}/bin/list_members ${list.name} command to
			export the subscribers list.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			There are a few things to note before doing the final migration:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Ensure that the mysqld <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/packet-too-large.html">max_allowed_packet</a>
						setting is large enough to accodimate the
						largest archived mail message you might have.
						During import, it makes sense to make this value
						some huge number (say 54M). Once you
						have done the import, you can set this back to a
						lower value (say 15M).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you are uploading a mbox file across the network,
						make sure that it is a fast network connection in order to
						not hit any timeouts as a result of things taking a long time.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>
				Now you are ready to import the archives. Go to List
				Admin Menu->Import and upload your mbox file. If the
				import fails for any reason, please let us know. Also,
				do not worry if it fails, the import process is smart
				enough to see any saved messages and not re-import them
				when you try again.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once the archives are available and you feel comfortable
				with that, copy/paste the subscriber list into List
				Admin Menu->Mass Subscribe. Chances are that you will
				just want to 'Silently subscribe' your members.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, shut down your mailman instance and re-configure
				your mail system to send messages to SubEtha.
			</p>
