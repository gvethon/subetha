		<h2>SubEtha Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>What JDK version does SubEtha require?</dt>
			<dd>SubEtha requires JDK1.5 or later.</dd>
			
			<dt>What JBoss version does SubEtha require?</dt>
			<dd>JBoss 4.0.4.GA or (possibly) newer</dd>

			<dt>Does SubEtha run on other J2EE appservers?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Not currently.  SubEtha uses a fair amount of JBoss-specific
				code both in places where the J2EE spec is incomplete (or
				useless, ie authorization) and in places where it was very
				convenient (ie @Service beans and Message-Driven POJOs).</p>
				
				<p>We view the appserver not as an operating system in which
				users run applications, but as a large library around which
				applications like SubEtha are built.  Users install SubEtha;
				they should not have to care what components power it.</p>
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Which databases does SubEtha support?</dt>
			<dd>Any that work with JBoss EJB3 (aka Hibernate) and provide
				reasonable BLOB support.  The works-out-of-the-box
				distribution will be set up to use Apache Derby by default,
				but detailed instructions will be provided for others. The 
				developers are primarily using MySQL.</dd>

			<dt>Does SubEtha work with my Mail Transport Agent (eg Postfix, Sendmail, Exim, Qmail)?</dt>
			<dd>Yes, in fact, SubEtha currently requires an external MTA to deliver mail.
				The developers all use Postfix, but any MTA should work.
				See the <a href="integration.html">integration page</a>.
				In the future, it will be possible to use SubEtha without
				an MTA.</dd>


			<dt>Does SubEtha support i18n (internationalization)?</dt>

			<dd><p>SubEtha's text strings (ie: web interface, error messages, etc.) haven't been
				internationalized with different languages (yet), but SubEtha should
				pass messages through written in any language with any character
				encoding.  There are two exceptions to this:  Email is always
				rendered as UTF-8 in the web archives, and list owners may
				install filters which replace text in the mail message.  All substituted
				text is encoded with the platform default character set.</p>
				<p>We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> that you set your JVM's
				default character set to UTF-8.  You should read a more
				thorough discussion of <a href="i18n.html">internationalization issues
				in SubEtha</a>.</p></dd>
				
			<dt>My mailserver does not support 8BITMIME.</dt>
			<dd>First off, strongly consider switching to a mail server that does.
				It's not 1984 anymore. If that is not an option, edit 
				${jboss.dir}/server/default/deploy/mail-service.xml.
				Set mail.smtp.allow8bitmime=false</dd>

			<dt>Why does SubEtha store attachments in a separate table?</dt>
			<dd>1) they're huge, and we don't want to have to parse them when we're rendering the archive page
				2) they need to be accessed separately as links from the archives anyways
				3) if the msg bodies don't have attachments, it's reasonable to cache the whole msg 
				body in the 2nd level cache (currently done)</dd>
