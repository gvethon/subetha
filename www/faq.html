		<h2>SubEtha Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>What JDK version does SubEtha require?</dt>
			<dd>SubEtha requires JDK1.5 or later.</dd>
			
			<dt>What JBoss version does SubEtha require?</dt>
			<dd>JBoss 4.0.4.GA or (possibly) newer</dd>

			<dt>Does SubEtha run on other J2EE appservers?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Not currently.  SubEtha uses a fair amount of JBoss-specific
				code both in places where the J2EE spec is incomplete (or
				useless, ie authorization) and in places where it was very
				convenient (ie @Service beans and Message-Driven POJOs).</p>
				
				<p>We view the appserver not as an operating system in which
				users run applications, but as a large library around which
				applications like SubEtha are built.  Users install SubEtha;
				they should not have to care what components power it.</p>
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Which databases does SubEtha support?</dt>
			<dd>Any that work with JBoss EJB3 (aka Hibernate) and provide
				reasonable BLOB support.  The works-out-of-the-box
				distribution will be set up to use Apache Derby by default,
				but detailed instructions will be provided for others. The 
				developers are primarily using MySQL.</dd>

			<dt>Does SubEtha work with my Mail Transport Agent (eg Postfix, Sendmail, Exim, Qmail)?</dt>
			<dd>Yes, in fact, SubEtha currently requires an external MTA to deliver mail.
				The developers all use Postfix, but any MTA should work.
				See the <a href="integration.html">integration page</a>.
				In the future, it will be possible to use SubEtha without
				an MTA.</dd>

			<dt>Does SubEtha support i18n (internationalization)?</dt>
			<dd><p>SubEtha's text strings (ie: web interface, error messages, etc.) haven't been
				internationalized with different languages (yet), but SubEtha should
				pass messages through written in any language with any character
				encoding.  There are two exceptions to this:  Email is always
				rendered as UTF-8 in the web archives, and list owners may
				install filters which replace text in the mail message.  All substituted
				text is encoded with the platform default character set.</p>
				<p>We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> that you set your JVM's
				default character set to UTF-8.  You should read a more
				thorough discussion of <a href="i18n.html">internationalization issues
				in SubEtha</a>.</p></dd>
				
			<dt>What about 8bit MIME?</dt>
			<dd>JavaMail will parse messages in 8BITMIME just fine.  However, by default,
				JavaMail does not send mail in 8BITMIME.  This can be turned on in
				${jboss.dir}/server/default/deploy/mail-service.xml by setting the
				attribute mail.smtp.allow8bitmime=true.  We DO NOT recommend doing
				this with the current version of JavaMail.  We have found at least one
				bug whereby quoted-printable content with nonascii characters will
				have it's header changed to "8bit" without updating the actual contents.
				If this defect in JavaMail is corrected, this FAQ entry will change.</dd>

			<dt>Why does SubEtha store attachments in a separate table?</dt>
			<dd>1) they're huge, and we don't want to have to parse them when we're rendering the archive page
				2) they need to be accessed separately as links from the archives anyways
				3) message bodies without attachments are small enough to store in the
				2nd level cache, making archive reading fast and scalable.</dd>

			<dt>How does SubEtha compare to Mailman?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Both are open source mailing list managers.  In Mailman's favor:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mailman is a much more mature application.  SubEtha is relatively new and
						might possibly still have bugs.</li>
					<li>Mailman has a known performance profile.  While SubEtha should scale well,
						there are not yet any large SubEtha installations, so performance is still
						unproven.</li>
					<li>Mailman has a very large user community.  SubEtha is just getting started.</li>
					<li>Mailman stores data on a filesystem rather than using a database.  Some people
						would view this as a disadvantage.</li>
					<li>Mailman has a smaller memory footprint.  SubEtha requires a Java appserver.
						However, it should be noted that Mailman's qrunner footprint is not especially
						svelte, and JBoss can be slimmed down considerably in a low-traffic environment.</li>
					<li>Mailman has all the little quirky configuration options that only comes from years of
						obscure user requests and patching.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>In SubEtha's favor:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Features!  SubEtha offers virtual domains, role-based permissions, 
						keeping attachments on the server, searchable archives, and the ability
						for users to have multiple email addresses, among others.  The only major
						feature present in Mailman but missing in SubEtha is digest mode.</li>
					<li>Usability.  SubEtha works like a reasonably modern web application.
						Mailman's interface is... antiquated.</li>
					<li>Pluggability, automation, and integration.  You can write a wide variety of
						plugins for SubEtha, and SubEtha exposes much of it's internal
						machination as a public API.  You can plug in your own quirky obscure
						behaviors without patching the core.</li>
					<li>Theoretical scalablity.  In theory, SubEtha should easily scale into a cluster
						of dozens of machines.  However, nobody has tried this yet - if you do,
						we want to hear from you.</li>
					<li>SubEtha stores data in a database rather than using the filesystem.  Some
						people would view this as a disadvantage.</li>
					<li>SubEtha runs on Windows.  Yeah, we know, some people would view this as a
						disadvantage :-)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					We would like to think that SubEtha significantly raises the bar for what
					users expect a mailing list manager to do.  However, this is new software;
					expect a few rough edges.
				</p>
			</dd>
			
			<dt>I just sent a message to a list and it isn't showing up in the
				archives during a search!</dt>
			<dd>
			<p>This is because the thread which re-indexes the archives runs 
				about every ten minutes or so. Just give it some time and
				the message will show up.
