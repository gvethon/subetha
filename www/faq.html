		<h2>SubEtha Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>What JDK version does SubEtha require?</dt>
			<dd>SubEtha requires JDK1.5 or later for running and development.</dd>
			
			<dt>What JBoss version does SubEtha require?</dt>
			<dd>JBoss 4.0.4.CR2</dd>

			<dt>Does SubEtha run on other J2EE appservers?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Not currently.  SubEtha uses a fair amount of JBoss-specific
				code both in places where the J2EE spec is incomplete (or
				useless, ie authorization) and in places where it was very
				convenient (ie @Service beans and Message-Driven POJOs).</p>
				
				<p>We view the appserver not as an operating system in which
				users run applications, but as a large library around which
				applications like SubEtha are built.  Users install SubEtha;
				they should not have to care what components power it.</p>
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Which databases does SubEtha support?</dt>
			<dd>Any that work with JBoss EJB3 (aka Hibernate) and provide
				reasonable BLOB support.  The works-out-of-the-box
				distribution will be set up to use Apache Derby by default,
				but detailed instructions will be provided for others.</dd>

			<dt>Does SubEtha work with my Mail Transport Agent (eg Postfix, Sendmail, Exim, Qmail)?</dt>
			<dd>Yes, in fact, SubEtha currently requires an external MTA.
				The developers all use Postfix, but any MTA should work.
				See the <a href="integration.html">integration page</a>.
				In the future, it will be possible to use SubEtha without
				an MTA.</dd>
