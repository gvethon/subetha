		<h2>SubEtha Coding Conventions</h2>
		
		<p>
			The coding conventions are simple, and you will probably be
			fine with the Eclipse defaults.
		</p>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>4-space HARD tabs</dt>
			<dd>
				Most editors do this by default.  Trust the defaults.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Pascal-like {} positions</dt>
			<dd>
				Braces go on a line by themselves, outdented from their contents.
<pre>for (Object thing: collection)
{
	this.doSomething();
}</pre>
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Use explicit references to <em>this</em></dt>
			<dd>
				Refer to member variables and member methods:  this.doSomething();
				This doesn't work when inner classes refer to member variables in
				outer classes, but it's a rare enough case that you can ignore this
				rule.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>No member variable prefix</dt>
			<dd>
				Do not prefix member variables with a letter (ie, do not use mFoo).
				Just refer to it as this.foo in your code.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Code-as-literature</dt>
			<dd>
				Code should read like English, and when it doesn't read like English,
				it should have comments that are written in English.  Be liberal with
				punctuation and grammar.  Somebody has to read this stuff.
			</dd>
