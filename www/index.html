 <title>Sub-Etha Mailing List Manager</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>
		SubEtha is a sophisticated mailing list manager, similar in many respects
		to the popular Mailman package.  SubEtha's features include:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Very easy installation on Windows and Unix platforms</li>
		<li>A user-friendly web interface for all configuration management</li>
		<li>Virtual domains (ie list@foo.com and list@bar.com are separate lists)</li>
		<li>Intelligent VERP bounce processing</li>
		<li>Message processing 'mailets' which allow administrators to write
			plugins which can modify the message stream to allow features 
			we plan to offer, such as stripping of MIME attachments, spam detection  
			and insertion of advertising.</li>
		<li>Users can have multiple email addresses on a single list delivered 
			to a preferred address</li>
		<li>Users can self-moderate messages sent from unsubscribed addresses</li>
		<li>Searchable, threaded archives implemented with a UI that is similar
			to forum software with access control based viewing and posting</li>
		<li>Clusterable for nearly unlimited scalability</li>
		<li>Easy integration with any mail transport agent (MTA)</li>
		<li>EJB and SOAP interfaces for automation</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		SubEtha is a three-tiered J2EE application using EJB3 and JMS.  It is designed
		to deploy on JBoss and relies on numerous other open source projects including
		<a href="http://hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>, 
		<a href="http://tagonist.tigris.org">Tagonist</a>, and 
		<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This project is still in the design phase.  Its authors are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Jeff Schnitzer</li>
		<li>Scott Hernandez</li>
		<li>Ian McFarland</li>
		<li>Jon Stevens</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		There will be two distributions.  The first, for advanced administrators, is an
		EAR file which can be deployed into any JBoss instance.  The second, for novices,
		is a "just-unzip-and-run" package containing standalone JBoss with SubEtha 
		preconfgured and all unnecessary services removed.
