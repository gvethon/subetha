		<h2>Avoiding Vogon Poetry</h2>
		
		<p>
			Generally speaking, SubEtha tries to modify messages as little as possible
			as they are passed through the system.  Hopefully this means the receiver
			will see the message in the same encoding and character set that it was
			sent with.  However, there are a few cases where this might not be the case:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The SubEtha web interface always uses UTF-8.  All contents of
				Mail messages will be converted to this encoding before being
				rendered as HTML.</li>
			<li>SubEtha allows list administrators to use plugin modules called
				Mail Filters to arbitrarily manipulate the message stream.  When
				a mail filter adds text or replaces text in a header, it (almost)
				always uses the Java platform default encoding.  For example, a
				SubjectFilter may receive a message with the subject header
				encoded Shift-JIS, prepend "[ListName] ", and save the new header
				encoded with UTF-8.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			If you're running all your lists in your native language, you can
			ignore any of these settings and everything will probably work
			fine.  However, we recommend the following, especially if you
			plan to host lists in multiple languages:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Set the JVM platform default character encoding to UTF-8</h3>
				<p>
					This will cause any text that SubEtha creates or modifies
					to be encoded in the most portable form possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					HOW:  In the jboss start script (look in ${jboss.dir}/bin/run.conf
					or run.sh or run.bat), set <code>JAVA_OPTS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Make sure your database tables are UTF-8</h3>
				<p>
					If you want to use UTF-8, you need to store it that way.
					Fortunately most modern databases use UTF-8 by default.
				</p>
				<p>
					HOW:  This is, unfortunately, very specific to the database
					vendor.  For MySQL, you want to include the following in your
					my.cnf config file:
<pre>[mysqld]
default-character-set=utf8
</pre>
					Note that you must set this <strong>before</strong> you run
					SubEtha for the first time.  SubEtha creates the database
					schema for you, and will happily create them with the wrong
					charset.  If you do this wrong, either manually change the
					charset for each table (MySQL: alter table [tablename] character set=utf8)
					or drop the database and start again (this will delete your data!).
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Use substitution filters sparingly</h3>
				<p>
					The more you manipulate text, the more you risk replacing
					the original encoding of a message.  In particular, avoid
					the Subject filter on lists with multiple languages being
					supported.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
