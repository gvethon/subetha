		<h2>Setup Instructions for Development</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Install JBoss 4.04CR2 using the installer.  Choose the non-clustered ejb3
				install option, it boots much faster than the clustered option.  Do not
				enable call-by-value.  You do not need to secure your JBoss if you do not
				publicly expose your development server.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you install to a directory other than the default /java/jboss-4.0.4.CR2,
				you will need to set the ${jboss.dir} property.  Copy build.properties to
				a file called user.properties and edit ${jboss.dir}.
			</li>
			<li>
				Edit ${jboss.dir}/server/default/deploy/mail-service.xml and make
				sure the mail.smtp.host property value is set to your outgoing mail
				server.  The other config parameters are irrelevant.
				If you wish to run unit tests, you must have these two values:
				<ul>
					<li>mail.smtp.host set to localhost</li>
					<li>mail.smtp.port set to 2525 (you will have to create this line)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Download MySQL JDBC driver (MySQL Connector/J) from <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">here</a>.
				Copy to ${jboss.dir}/server/default/lib.  The file should be mysql-connector-java-X.X.XX-bin.jar.
				You can use a different RDBMS but you'll need to use a different -ds.xml file
				than the one described below.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you need/want to support international character sets in Subetha, it is probably a good idea to read
				through the <a href="i18n.html">I18N configuration documentation</a> at this point as there are 
				steps that must be completed there before going further in this setup.
			</li>
			<li>
				Create the data source by creating ${jboss.dir}/server/default/deploy/subetha-ds.xml.
				Use ${jboss.dir}/docs/examples/jca/mysql-ds.xml as a template.  The jndi-name must
				be SubEthaDS:
				<blockquote>&lt;jndi-name&gt;SubEthaDS&lt;/jndi-name&gt;</blockquote>
			</li>
			<li>
				One might also wish to define a database name as well. We like to use 
				the name 'subetha'. This is also defined in the subetha-ds.xml file: 
			    <blockquote>&lt;connection-url&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/subetha&lt;/connection-url&gt;</blockquote>

			</li>
			<li>
				Create a database schema called 'subetha' which can be accessed by the host, user
				and password specified in the -ds.xml file.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Directory Layout</h2>
		<p>
			The subdirectories correspond to various components:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				appmain - Build system for the main ear archive which gets deployed
				in the appserver.  No source code, just some packaging instructions
				and some metadata.  Depends on all of the other components.
			</li>
			<li>
				common - A common jar of utility classes, shared by all components.
				Includes some constants defined for the data model.
			</li>
			<li>
				core - The core business logic, implemented as a set of session EJBs.
				There may also be some service EJBs here.  There is also a special
				component built, a sar, which contains thirdparty jars and some
				configuration instructions to JBoss.
			</li>
			<li>
				plugin - Implementation of all the plugins distributed with SubEtha.
				Note that the plugin interfaces are part of core and built into the
				core api jar.
			</li>
			<li>
				entity - The data model.  Contains EJB3 entity beans and a simple
				session EJB Data Access Object pattern.  All queries are defined here
				as well.
			</li>
			<li>
				rtest - All junit regression testing code and instructions.  JUnit
				tests are remote clients to the core ejb interface.
			</li>
			<li>
				frontend - The front end web application, packaged as a war.  Contains
				JSPs and all other content, acts as a client to the core layer.
			</li>
			<li>
				smtp - A simple SMTP server which allows SubEtha to receive messages
				relayed by your MTA.  This simplifies MTA integration considerably.
				This module does not depend on any SubEtha classes and could be used
				by any project needing a receptive SMTP stack.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Running Regression Tests</h2>
		<p>
			How to run the JUnit regression tests from ant:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>First make sure JBoss is running.</li>
			<li>
				Make sure the code you want to test is deployed.  <em>ant deploy</em>
				will build the latest and deploy it.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make sure your ${jboss.dir}/server/default/deploy/mail-service.xml
				points to localhost, port 2525.  Make sure this port is free; the
				unit tests start a mock SMTP server on this port.
			</li>
			<li>
				Run <em>ant junit</em>.  All your regression tests will run.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want to run just one set of tests, edit the junit.special.tests
				property in your build.properties or better yet user.properties.  Then
				run the <em>ant junit-special</em> target.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want to run the special unit test(s) in the debugger,
				run the <em>ant junit-debug</em> target.  The JVM will pause
				and wait until you attach with Eclipse.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Coding Conventions</h2>
		<p>
			You may wish to read the <a href="coding.html">SubEtha Coding Conventions</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Startup</h2>
		<p>
			Start up JBoss.  The web interface is 
			<a href="http://localhost:8080/se/">http://localhost:8080/se/</a>
			When SubEtha runs for the first time, it creates a site administrator
			account named <strong>root@localhost</strong>, with the password
			<strong>password</strong>.
