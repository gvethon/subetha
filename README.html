			For installation instructions, see <a href="www/install.html">the install guide</a>.
		</p>

		<p>

			Note!  This version requires upgrading JBossAS 4.0.4.GA with JBossWS 1.0.3.  SubEtha

			will not deploy without this upgrade of the web services component.

		</p>

		<p>

			You may also notice a small google ad in the dead space under the menus; we

			think of this as a small donation for our long nights writing this (free)

			software. If you wish to remove it, see the <a href="www/faq.html">FAQ</a> for

			instructions.
