#summary Integrating SubEtha with Exim

= Exim =

These notes apply to version v4.61.

This config will create a domain (or subdomain) filter to relay all messages to smtp://localhost:2500. To do this we create a fake email (sub)domain (@lists.localhost) while still allowing local delivery for @localhost addresses.

Make the following changes to etc/*exim.config*.

==== Transports Section: ====
  {{{
  local_smtp_port_2500:
  driver = smtp
  port = 2500
  allow_localhost = true
  gethostbyname = true
  hosts=localhost
  }}}

Notes:
  * *gethostbyname*: This resolves hosts using alternate sources like etc/hosts instead of just through dns mx records.
  * *allow_localhost*: This is usually not allowed to help keep mail-loops under control. :) Since we are running a totally different mail server on localhost:2500 we have no worries that the message will loop back into the same system.

==== Routers Section: ====
  {{{
  subetha:
    driver=accept
    domains=lists.localhost
    self=send
    transport=local_smtp_port_2500
    no_more
  }}}

*Note* - I found while working with Cygwin that every time I changed etc/exim.config file the permissions were changed to my current windows account:
  {{{
  -rwx------+ 1 *skot* None 31250 May  8 20:48 /etc/exim.conf
  }}}

This was problematic as exim was setup to run as a service and should have had the following permissions:
  {{{
  -rw-rw-r--+ 1 SYSTEM *root* 31250 May  8 20:48 /etc/exim.conf
  }}}

To fix this problem I had to continuously re-run {{{exim-config}}}, or change the permissions manually.
