#summary Changes between releases

For specific instructions to upgrade between versions, see UpgradingVersions.

= Changes =

== 2.0 ==

 * For 2.0, SubEtha was ported to Resin 4.0 (see WhyResin).
 * Many architectural changes were made but very few features were added.
 * We've moved to a new home at google code.

 * Here are some of the changes to note:
   * Updated libraries (Hibernate, Logging, SubethaSMTP)
   * Updated packaging and docs
   * Developed and tested on MySQL and PostgresSQL
   * Allow "sent on behalf of" emails (ie. Sender: and From: are different)
   * Denser encoding for shorter VERP envelope sender length
   * Minor HTML changes on various pages.
   * Added Hessian remote protocol support (removed "WS" remoting)
   * Indexing and Cleanup start shortly after deployment, and periodically as before
   * Much smaller memory footprint, and much quicker startup (20s on dev machines vs minutes for JBoss)

If you are upgrading from a previous version, these changes *must* be
made to the database (these are for MySQL, your database data types may be
different):
