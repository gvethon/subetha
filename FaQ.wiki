== SubEtha Frequently Asked Questions ==

== Help! ==

  * I just sent a message to a list and it isn't showing up in the archives during a search!

  This is because the thread which re-indexes the archives runs about every ten minutes or so. Just give it some time and the message will show up.
	
  * My system is too quiet, I want more debug output in the console!
    
  Well, you asked for it and here it comes. Drink from the firehose by editing any ResinConfiguration file (ie ${RESIN_HOME}/conf/resin.xml or ${RESIN_HOME}/conf/subetha.xml)

== Tech Specs ==

  * What JDK version does SubEtha require?

  SubEtha requires JDK1.6 or later.
 
  * What Resin version does SubEtha require?

  Currently Resin 4.0.0.  Due to evolution of the JSR299 CanDI spec, we will need to make a new release of SubEtha for the next functioning version of Resin; 4.0.1 unfortunately contains showstopper bugs.  4.0.2 is likely.
 
  * Does SubEtha run on other J2EE appservers?

  Not currently.  J2EE portability is a myth - it's possible to port an application, but it takes a lot of work.  We know, we migrated from JBoss to Resin in early 2009.  See WhyResin.

  * Which databases does SubEtha support?

  Any that work with Hibernate and provide reasonable BLOB support. The developers use MySQL and Postgres.
 
  * Does SubEtha work with my Mail Transport Agent (eg Postfix, Sendmail, Exim, Qmail)?

  Yes.  There are two aspects to this:  One, SubEtha currently requires an MTA to actually deliver outbound mail.  Two, SubEtha can run behind your MTA when ReceivingMail.  In the future, it may be possible to use SubEtha without an MTA entirely.
 
  * Does SubEtha support i18n (internationalization)?
  
  SubEtha's text strings (ie: web interface, error messages, etc.) haven't been internationalized with different languages (yet), but SubEtha should pass messages through written in any language with any character encoding. There are two exceptions to this: Email is always rendered as UTF-8 in the web archives, and list owners may install filters which replace text in the mail message. All substituted text is encoded with the platform default character set.

  We *strongly recommend* that you set your JVM's default character set to UTF-8. Please read a more thorough discussion of [I18N] issues in SubEtha.

  * What about 8bit MIME?

  JavaMail will parse messages in 8BITMIME just fine.  Historically, JavaMail has had [http://osdir.com/ml/java.sun.javamail.general/2006-05/msg00030.html problems] sending mail with 8BITMIME.  Since it seems to work now, we have enabled this by default (see example-subetha.xml).  If you think you are having problems, please post to the SubEtha Users mailing list.

== Design Questions ==

  * Why does SubEtha store attachments in a separate table?
  We have a few reasons:
    # They're huge, and we don't want to have to parse them when we're rendering the archive page, or really ever. 
    # They need to be accessed separately as links from the archives anyways.
    # Message bodies without attachments are small enough to store in the 2nd level cache, making archive reading fast and scalable.

== Huh, Ads ==

  * What's with the google ad?

  Developing SubEtha was a major effort, requiring several months of fulltime work by several engineers motivated by the bizarre notion "wouldn't it be cool!" The thought that we might be able to get beer money out of this project didn't occur to us until long after the fact.

  Rather than asking for donations, we've added the least obtrusive google ad we could find to the dead space under the menus. We hope it's not too irritating, but if it is, you are welcome to remove it. We won't be upset.

  * How do I remove the google ad?

  Run the system at least once (to unpack the war), then edit the file ${resin.dir}/webapps/se/WEB-INF/tags/trim/list.tag.  There is a comment next to the HTML that you should remove.

  * Can't you just make that a config option?

  Come now. We went through all this trouble to write SubEtha, the least you can do is put a little effort into your mean (mean!) attempts to circumvent our beer money collection scheme.

== API ==

 * Is there an example of communicating with Subetha via HessianPHP?

  Why, [http://wiki.itadmins.net/doku.php?id=subetha:hessianphp yes there is]!
