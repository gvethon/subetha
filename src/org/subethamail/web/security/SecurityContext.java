 * Hides the mess of security management in the web tier.  The

 * 
 * 1) J2EE security APIs are deficient to the point of defective.
 * 2) JBoss' security APIs are convoluted as all hell.
 * 
 * Putting one of these in a user's HTTP session and
 * enabling the SecurityAssociationFilter will give
 * you most of the way you wished the web tier worked.
